    "text": "ZARR and the European Space Agency (ESA)\nThe ESA is moving Copernicus to ZARR, launching its Earth Observation Processing Framework (EOPF) data format (Zarr). ZARR is “a community project to develop specifications and software for storage of large N-dimensional typed arrays”.\nA ZARR is a dataset consisting of trees of array chunks stored (usually) in object storage and indexed by fairly simple JSON metadata that describes how those chunks align together in one potentially very large array. The idea is that all the metadata lives upfront in instantly readable JSON, and changes made to the dataset (extending it each day as new data arrives) affects only the relevant chunks and the small parts of the JSON. This is different to a long list of NetCDFs that grows every day, where the metadata is self-contained for each file and there is no overarching abstraction for the entire file set.\nZARR is usually in object storage, and loaded by datacube software such as xarray. It’s not intended to be zipped into a huge file and downloaded or read, the real power lies in the entire dataset being lazy, and understood by software that needs just one data set description (url, or S3 path, etc)."

(Note that dimension 0 is the “3rd” dimension in normal thinking, here that dimension is “band” or a dimension for each of red, green, blue in the quicklook image).\n\ncc &lt;- md$AsClassicDataset(2L, 1L)\ntr &lt;- unlist(cc$GetGeoTransform())\ndm &lt;- c(cc$RasterXSize, cc$RasterYSize)\ncc$GetSpatialRef() ## empty, so we retrieve from the attributes\ncrs &lt;- cc$GetMetadata()[[\"proj:wkt2\"]]\n\nNow, I used reproj_extent to convert the dataset’s bbox to one in longlat, but I won’t share that here, we’ll just use the result so our map is a little more familiar. The source data xy bbox is xmin: 300000 ymin: 4490220  xmax: 409800 ymax:4600020, and we take small section of that which is this in longitude latitude:\n\n# xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax converted below to bbox \nex &lt;- c(31.689, 31.774, 40.665, 40.724)\n\nTo warp the imagery to this region we first need to set the CRS properly on the dataset, so translate to a temporary VRT and use that dataset for the next step.\n\ndsvrt &lt;- gdal$Translate(tempfile(fileext = \".vrt\", tmpdir = \"/vsimem\"), cc, options = c(\"-a_srs\", crs))\ntf &lt;- tf &lt;- \"/vsimem/result.tif\"\nww &lt;- gdal$Warp(tf, dsvrt,  dstSRS = \"EPSG:4326\", outputBounds = ex[c(1, 3, 2, 4)])\nww$Close()\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nFinally we can read the image, plot it, obtain some contextual data and be assured that our map is correct.\n\nlibrary(gdalraster)\ndata &lt;- read_ds(new(GDALRaster, tf))\n\n\nlibrary(osmdata)\nx &lt;- opq(ex[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]) |&gt; add_osm_feature(key = \"highway\") |&gt; osmdata_sf()\n\nlibrary(sf)\nplot_raster(data)\nplot(x$osm_lines[0], add = TRUE, col = \"hotpink\")"

In terms of this post, it has very low-level development facilities, written in C++.

Often you don’t need C++ and can use Python, and sometimes you can use R depending on what is exposed there. Sometimes you need to modify GDAL itself, and you can do anything you want then(!), which is how open source is supposed to work.\nKey feature of the gdalwarp_lib.cpp GDALWarp() C++ function, versus the GDALWarpDirect(), GDALWarpIndirect() and the lower level GDALWarpMulti() and GDALWarpImage() functions.\nWhen we use gdalwarp_lib, we get handling of multiple-zoom level sources without intervention on our own.\nMost use cases I see of the warper facilities are for whole-sale conversion of large datasets, multiple input files converted to a another projection in a large output file or series of tiles."

    "section": "The warper is also a generalized RasterIO",
    "text": "The warper is also a generalized RasterIO\n(rasterio is a famous python package for using GDAL’s raster facilities, it’s not what we mean here).\nRasterIO is a C++ function in the GDAL library, its job is to take a source data set (i.e. a path to GeoTIFF) and to provide you with a window of pixels from that source. A window can be a subset, the entire raster, or a resampling (i.e. fewer pixels than native) of either the entire or a subset of the raster.\nIt’s really, cool and using it looks like this:\nerr = rasterBand-&gt;RasterIO(GF_Read, \n                           Xoffset, Yoffset, \n                           nXSize, nYSize,\n                           &double_scanline[0], \n                           outXSize, outYSize, \n                           GDT_Float64,\n                           0, 0, &psExtraArg);\nThere is a lot going on in that function call, but in short the key parts are (these are my argument-variable-names):\n\nrasterBand-&gt;RasterIO() is the way we read a pixel values, we have a raster band and we call the member function RasterIO()\nXoffset, Yoffset is the first column and row we should consider for reading (0,0 if we start at the top left corner)\nnXSize, nYSize\noutXSize, outYSize is the dimension of the window we get out\n\nThat last bits, the two kinds of Size is the magic, we can ask to start at a particular row,column and read out a given number of pixels in x and y. But, not only that we can specifiy where to end in the source. If nXSize and outXSize are not equal in value then we have asked for a resampling of the source “only read every nXSize / outXSize values in the x direction. If they are equal, just read every one. Note also that we might ask for an outX/YSize that is larger than the source nXSize/nYSize - and this would give us a resampling to higher resolution. This is really where the resampling algorithm comes in. ‘Nearest neighbour’ would give us copies of pixels, ‘Bilinear’ and interpolation between source pixels for new pixels in between. Other algorithms include ‘Cubic’, ‘Lanczos’, ‘Average’, ‘Sum’.\nThis is the key behind the fast and lazy reads provided by the terra and sf packages in R, this was originally available also in rgdal and raster made heavy use of it.\nBut, what is the offset and the size? We really want to think in geographic coordinates, and this is exactly what crop() does for example. We get a discretized crop, not an exact one because we only get to read by this raster-based mechanism - we are bound to the size and alignment of the source pixels.\nUnder the hood, functions like crop() do the following:\noffsets/scale vs. xlim,ylim\nThe other arguments in RasterIO.\n\nGF_Read controls the mode we are into (read or write or update)\nGDT_Float64 controls the type of data we get out (64 bit doubles here, GDAL will auto-convert if the source is different type)\n0, 0, &psExtraArg are further details we won’t discuss (though, the way resampling is done is controlled in the extra args options).\n\nWhat are its limitations:\n\nonly one source at a time, you can’t resample from multiple rasters at once (we are using offset/size indexing so the rasters must all be the same shape, you can read multiple bands)\n\n\nWhat is interesting about RasterIO vs. Warping is that we would never ever use warping for pure graphics. It doesn’t make sens"

    "text": "For some time I have used GDAL as a standard tool in my kit, I was introduced to the concept by the rgdal package authors and it slowly dawned on me what it meant to have a geo-spatial data abstraction library. To realize what this meant I had spent a lot of time in R, reading (primarily) MapInfo TAB and MIF format files as well (of course) as shapefiles, and the occasional GeoTIFF.\nI already knew how immensely powerful R was, with its epic flexibity and useability and I could just sense there was a brighter way once I understood many more details. As my experience grew I was able to do amazing tasks like, merge a few shapefiles together into one, or plot a window of data from a georeferenced grid. Previously the best I’d done in this space was VBScript in Manifold GIS, which I could use to automate some data tasks - but the prospects of full automation from raw data files to output, end-to-end with a software tool that anyone could use was absolutely mind-blowing. I was super-powered, I remember earning a carton of beer from a colleague of my father, for munging some SHP or TAB files between AGD66 and GDA94 … or something, and I knew I had a bright future ahead.\nSo what’s the abstraction? GDAL does not care what format the data is in, it could be points, lines, areas, a raster DEM, a time series of remote sensing, or an actual image. It just doesn’t mind, there’s an interpretation in its model for what’s in the file (or data base, or web server) and it will deliver that interpretation to you, very efficiently. If you understand that intepretation you can do a whole lot of amazing stuff. When this works well it’s because the tasks are modular, you have a series of basic tools designed to work together, and it’s up to you as a developer or a user to chain together the pieces to solve your particular problem."

    "text": "Where does this get difficult?\nGDAL is a C++ library, and that’s not accessible to most users or developers. The other key user-interface is the set of command line utilities, these are called gdal_translate, gdalinfo, ogr2ogr, ogrinfo, and many others. The command line is also not that accessible to many users, though it’s more so than C++ - this is why command line is a key topic for Software Carpentry. These interfaces give very high fidelity to the native interpretation provided by the GDAL model.\nGDAL is used from many languages, there’s Python, R, Perl, C#, Fortran, and it is bundled into many, many softwares - a very long list. The original author wrote code for some of the most influential geo-spatial software the world has, and some of that is in GDAL, some is locked up forever in propietary forms. He saw this as a problem and very early on engineered the work to be able to be open, in the do anything with me, including privatize me-license called MIT. Have a look in the source code for gdalwarp, you’ll see the company who was the best at raster reprojection in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nPython is surely the closest other language to the native interpretation, but then it’s not that simple, and this is not that story …\nR has a very particular interpretation of the GDAL interpretation, it’s called rgdal and if you are familiar with the GDAL model and with R you can see a very clear extra layer there. This extra level is there partly because of when it was done, the goals of the authors, the community response to the amazingly powerful facilities it provided, but also and perhaps mainly because it was very hard. R’s rather peculiar API meant that in the early 2000s the authors had to write in another language, a language between the native GDAL C++ and the R user language - this is the R API, it’s full of SEXP and UNPROTECTs and if you search this issue you’ll see clear signals not to bother - now you should just get on with learning Rcpp.\nThese extra levels are there in the R API, the hard stuff down in the rgdal/src/ folder but also in the R code itself. There’s a bunch of rigorous rules applied there, things to help protect us from that lower level, and to save from making serious analytical mistakes. All of this was very hard work and very well-intended, but it’s clear that it takes us away from the magic of the GDAL abstraction, we have a contract with rgdal, the R code has a contract with the R API, and the rgdal/src has a contract with GDAL. All of these things divorce R users and developers from the original schemes that GDAL provides, because at the R level rgdal itself has to provide certain guarantees and contracts with both R and with R users. I think that is too much for one package.\nAdd to this the complex zoo of formats, the other libraries that GDAL requires for full use. The Windows rgdal on CRAN doesn’t include HDF4, or HDF5, or NetCDF, or DODS - there are many missing things in this list, and it’s not clear if it’s because it’s hard, it’s against the license (ECW might be tricky, MrSID most definitely would be), or because no one has asked or maybe no one knows how, or maybe CRAN doesn’t want to. (Would you know how to find out?) All of these things add up to being way too much for one package. It’s kind of impossible, though now there are many more eyes on the problem and progress is being made. Who should decide these things? How would anyone know it’s even an issue?\nI wonder if many of us see rgdal as the definition of the GDAL abstraction. I see pretty clearly the difference, and while the package has been extremely useful for me I’ve long wanted lower level control and access to the GDAL core itself. (I had rather influential guidance from extremely expert programmers I’ve worked with, and I’ve discussed GDAL with many others, including employees of various companies, and across various projects and with many users. I assume most R users don’t know much about the details, and why would they want to?).\nThere is active work to modernize rgdal, and you should be aware of the immensely successful sf and the soon to be stars project. sf is an R interpretation of the Simple Features Standard (GDAL has an interpretation of that standard too, sf starts there when it reads with GDAL). stars will start with GDAL as a model for gridded data, and it’s not yet fleshed out what the details of that will be. None of these interpretations are permanent, though while the simple features standard is unlikely to change, there is no doubt that GDAL will evolve and include more features that don’t involve that standard. These things do change and very few people, relatively, are engaged in the decisions that are made. (GDAL could definitely benefit from more input, also something I’ve long wanted to do more of).\nIt’s been a long time, but I’ve recently found a way over the key obstacle I had - building a package to compile for use in R with bindings to GDAL itself. I have a lot to thank Roger Bivand and Edzer Pebesma for many years of instruction and guidance in that, in many different ways. I also am extremely grateful to R-Core for the overall environment, and the tireless work done by the CRAN maintainers. I have to mention Jeroen Ooms and Mark Padgham who’ve been extremely helpful very recently. This is something I’ve wanted to be able to do for a really long time, I hope this post helps provide context to why, and I hope it encourages some more interest in the general topic."

I’ve needed them and I’ve started to learn a whole lot more about what I’m going to do next with them. I recommend that any R user with an interest in geo-spatial or GDAL facilities have a closer look at how they work - and if you know there’s a lower level below the interpretations provide in R you should explore them. Rcpp and the modern tools for R really do make this immensely more easy than in the past (RStudio has intellisense for C++ …).\nI also believe strongly that R is well-placed to write the future of multi-dimensional and hierarchical and complex structured and geo-spatial data.

To run this we need to make a Planar Straight Line Graph from the polygons, but this is fairly straightforward by tracing through paired vertices in the data set. The key parts of the PSLG are the vertices P and the segment indexes S defining paired vertices for each line segment. This is a “structural” index where the index values are bound to the actual size and shape of the vertices, as opposed to a more general but perhaps less efficient relational index.\n\npslgraph &lt;- gris:::mkpslg(gobject)\ndim(pslgraph$P)\n\n[1] 21165     2\n\nrange(pslgraph$S)\n\n[1]     1 21165\n\nhead(pslgraph$P)\n\n            x_       y_\n[1,] -61.68667 17.02444\n[2,] -61.88722 17.10527\n[3,] -61.79445 17.16333\n[4,] -61.72917 17.60861\n[5,] -61.85306 17.58305\n[6,] -61.87306 17.70389\n\nhead(pslgraph$S)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    2\n[2,]    2    3\n[3,]    3    1\n[4,]    1    1\n[5,]    4    5\n[6,]    5    6\n\n\nThe PSLG is what we need for the triangulation.\n\ntri &lt;- RTriangle::triangulate(pslgraph)\n\nThe triangulation vertices (long-lat) can be converted to XYZ, and plotted.\n\nxyz &lt;- llh2xyz(cbind(tri$P, 0))\nopen3d()\n\nnull \n   5 \n\ntriangles3d(xyz[t(tri$T), ], col = \"grey\", specular = \"black\")\naspect3d(\"iso\"); bg3d(\"grey12\")\nrglwidget()\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are very ugly polygons since there’s no internal vertices to carry the curvature of this sphere. This is the same problem we’d face if we tried to drape these polygons over topography: at some point we need internal structure.\nLuckily Triangle can set a minimum triangle size. We set a constant minimum area, which means no individual triangle can be larger in area than so many “square degrees”. This gives a lot more internal structure so the polygons are more elegantly draped around the surface of the sphere. (There’s not really enough internal structure added with this minimum area, but I’ve kept it simpler to make the size of this document more manageable).\n\ntri &lt;- RTriangle::triangulate(pslgraph, a = 9)  ## a (area) is in degrees, same as our vertices\nxyz &lt;- llh2xyz(cbind(tri$P, 0))\nopen3d()\n\nnull \n   6 \n\ntriangles3d(xyz[t(tri$T), ], col = \"grey\", specular = \"black\")\nbg3d(\"gray12\")\nrglwidget()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe still can’t identify individual polygons as we smashed that information after putting the polygon boundary segments through the triangulator.

Traditionally this is handled by individuals who either have or quickly gain expert knowledge about the minute details regarding obtaining data sources, exploring and extracting data from them, manipulating the data for the required purpose and reporting results. Often this task is not the primary goal, it’s simply a requirement for comparison to environmental data or validation of direct measurements or modelled scenarios against independent data.\nThis is a complex area, it touches on big data, web services, complex and sophisticated multi-dimensional scientific data in array formats (primarily NetCDF), map projections, and data aesthetics or scaling methods by which data values are converted into visualizations.\nR is not known to be strong in this area for handling large and complex array-based data, although it has had good support for every piece in the chain many of them were either not designed to work together or or languished without modernization for some time. There are many many approaches to bring it all together but unfortunately no concerted effort to sort it all out. What there is however is a very exciting and productive wave of experimentation and new packages to try, there’s a lot of exploration occurring and a lot of powerful new approaches.\nROpenSci is producing a variety of valuable new R packages for scientific exploration and analysis. It and the RConsortium are both contributing directly into this ecosystem, with the latter helping to foster developments in simple features (polygons, lines and points), interactive map editing and an integration of large raster data handling."

    "text": "Cool right!?\nThis is extremely cool, there is a lot of exciting new support for these sometimes challenging sources of data. However, there is unfortunately no concerted vision for integration of multi-dimensional data into the tidyverse and many of the projects created for data getting and data extraction must include their own internal handlers for downloading and caching data sources and converting data into required forms. This is a complex area, but in some places it is harder and more complex than it really needs to be.\nTo put some guides in this discussion, the rest of this post is informed by the following themes.\n\nthe tidyverse is not just cool, it’s totally awesome (also provides a long-term foundation for the future)\n“good software design” facilitates powerful APIs and strong useability: composable, orthogonal components and effortless exploration and workflow development\nnew abstractions are still to be found\n\nThe tidyverse is loudly loved and hated. Critics complain that they already understood long-form data frames and that constant effusive praise on twitter is really annoying. Supporters just sit agog at a constant stream of pointless shiny fashion parading before their eyes … I mean, they fall into a pit of success and never climb out. Developers who choose the tidyverse as framework for their work appreciate its seamless integration of database principles and actual databases, the consistent and systematic syntax of composable single-purpose functions with predictable return types, the modularization and abstractability of magrittr piping, and the exciting and disruptive impact of tidy evaluation seen clearly already in dplyr and family, but which will clearly make it very easy to traverse the boundary between being a user and being a developer. What could be a better environment for the future of science and research?"

I remember clearly learning about the use of the graphics::image function for visualizing 2D kernel density maps created using sm. I have a life-long shudder reflex at the heat.colors palette, and at KDE maps generally. I also remember my first encounter with the NetCDF format which would have looked exactly like this (after waiting half and hour to download this file).\n\nprint(sst.file)\n\n[1] \"ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/noaa.oisst.v2/sst.wkmean.1990-present.nc\"\n\nlibrary(RNetCDF)\ncon &lt;- open.nc(file.path(dp, sst.file))\nlon &lt;- var.get.nc(con, \"lon\")\nlat &lt;- var.get.nc(con, \"lat\")\nxlim &lt;- c(140, 155)\nylim &lt;- c(-50, -35)\nxsub &lt;- lon &gt;= xlim[1] & lon &lt;= xlim[2]\nysub &lt;- lat &gt;= ylim[1] & lat &lt;= ylim[2]\ntlim  &lt;- \"oh just give up, it's too painful ...\"\ntime &lt;- var.get.nc(con, \"time\")\n## you get the idea, who can be bothered indexing time as well these days\nv &lt;- var.get.nc(con, \"sst\", start = c(which(xsub)[1], length(ysub) - max(which(ysub)), length(time)), count = c(sum(xsub), sum(ysub), 1))\nimage(lon[xsub], rev(lat[ysub]), v[nrow(v):1, ], asp = 1/cos(42 * pi/180))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a hassle! Let’s just use raster. (These aren’t the same but I really don’t care about making sure the old way works, the new way is much better - when it works, which is mostly …).\n\nlibrary(raster)\n\nLoading required package: sp\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'raster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\nb &lt;- brick(file.path(dp, sst.file))\n\nLoading required namespace: ncdf4\n\nnlayers(b)\n\n[1] 1685\n\nraster(b)\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 180, 360, 64800  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 1, 1  (x, y)\nextent     : 0, 360, -90, 90  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs \n\n## what time did you want?\n\nplot(crop(subset(b, nlayers(b) - c(1, 0)), extent(xlim, ylim), snap = \"out\"), col = heat.colors(12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are pretty cruddy data anyway, 1 degree resolution, weekly time steps? Come on man!\nWhy is this data set relevant? For a very long time the Optimally Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature data set, known fondly as Reynolds SST in some circles, was a very important touchstone for those working in marine animal tracking. From the earliest days of tuna tracking by (PDF): Northwest Pacific by light-level geo-locators, a regional or global data set of surface ocean temperatures was a critical comparison for tag-measured water temperatures. The strong and primarily zonal-gradients (i.e. varying by latitude, it gets cold as you move towards the poles) in the oceans provided an informative corrective to “light level geo-location” latitude estimates, especially when plagued by total zonal ambiguity (see Figure 12.3) around the equinoxes.\nToday we can use much finer resoution blended products for the entire globe. Blended means it’s a combination of measured (remote-sensing, bucket off a ship) and modelled observations, that’s been interpolated to “fill gaps”. This is not a simple topic of course, remotely sensed temperatures must consider whether it is day or night, how windy it is, the presence of sea ice, and many other factors - but as a global science community we have developed to the point of delivering a single agreed data set for this property. And now that it’s 2017, you have the chance of downloading all 5000 or so daily files, the total is only 2000 Gb.\nSo nothing’s free right? You want high-resolution, you get a big download bill."

Gridded data comes in many forms, geographic with longitude-latitude or projected spaces, with time and or depth dimensions, with different orderings of axes (i.e. time-first, the latitude-longitude), and with generally any arbitrary space. A space is simply a set of axes with particular units and projection, and yes we mean “space” and “projection” in the more general mathematical sense. Date-time data is a projection, there is a mapping of a particular set of values to the real line and the position on that line for particular instant is defined by the axis units and epoch.\nMesh and grid share the same meaning in some contexts."

Unstructured grids include triangulations, non-regularly binned histograms, tetrahedral meshes and ragged arrays.\nAn unstructured mesh (grid) is able to represent any data structure, but structured meshes have some advantages because of the regular indexing relationship between dimensions.\nGIS vector constructs “polygons”, “lines”, “points” are special case optimizations of the unstructured grid case. Polygons really are topologically identical to lines, and they are a dead-end in the broader scheme of dimensionality. Points and lines can are topologicaly 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional respectively, and this shape-constraint is the same no matter what geometric dimension they are defined in. A line can twist around a 4D space with x, y, z, t coordinates at its segment nodes or it can be constrained to single dimension with only one of those coordinates specifying its position. The topology of the line is completely independent of the geometry, if we treat the line as composed of topological primitives.\nPolygons are not composed of topological primitives, but they can be treated as being composed of line primitives."

The neat thing for me about 3D graphics is the requirement for mesh forms of data, and the fact that meshes are extremely useful for very many tasks. When we plot data in 3D we necessarily have to convert the usual spatial types into mesh forms. You can see me discuss that in more detail in this talk."

Both vb and ib had four rows, and so while I understood that a quad must have 4 vertices (4 index values for every primitive), I did not understand why the vertices also had four rows.\n(There are other kinds of primitives in common use are edge, point, tetrahedron - but rgl has no formal class for these - in practice the edge type is referred to as segment in rgl, and tetrahedra are approximated by enclosing their shape with triangles)."

The data values stored in a tile are a nother matter, these are like variables - we might have 1 variable (say elevation) stored in a double floating point value, or we might have 3 variables of byte values for storing an RGB image. These are independent concepts to the size of the tile, and strictly there may be no variables at all, just the abstract idea of the tiling.\nAnother kind of block, or tile is a the scanline of a raster. Imagine reading each row of the raster, from the top row to the bottom. Each line is its own kind of degenerate tile. We can read from a raster this way no matter what its internal tiling is, just software might be opening several tiles and reading just one line from each.

    "section": "Degenerate Rectilinear Coordinates",
    "text": "Degenerate Rectilinear Coordinates\nI have taken to saying this phrase to describe a particular situation in array handling. I get confused responses, or normally just no response or feedback on the term itself. I think it’s extremely important though. Python communities raced up to where R was a few years back and just sped on by without any nod to what R folks had learned, I think that’s a huge failure and I take it personally.\nHere’s what it is. Let’s say we have a pretty low resolution grid of the world, we break up the entire range of longitude and latitude into intervals, 360 for meridians and 180 for parallels.\n(This is neat because in whole number terms, this is exactly the right number).\nSo, define a grid, we make it a farily typical 1-degree-per-pixel grid of the entire globe flattened unceremoniously from an\nangular coordinate system “longitude and latitude” to one where we just plot those numbers in x,y on a flat plane.\n\n## define a grid in -180,180 -90,90 (360x180)\ndm &lt;- c(360, 180)\nxlim &lt;- c(-180, 180)\nylim &lt;- c(-90, 90)\n\n## create a grid\ndat &lt;- matrix(c(0, 1, -1, 0), 2L, 2L)[rep(1:2, each = 180), rep(1:2, each = 90)]\n## we don't get much from this because 0,1 0,1\n## and the world isn't 0,360 0,180 anyway (that would have been handy!)\n#image(dat)\n\n\nxs &lt;- seq(xlim[1], xlim[2], length.out = dm[1] + 1)\nys &lt;- seq(ylim[1], ylim[2], length.out = dm[2] + 1)\nimage(xs, ys, dat, asp = 1)\nmaps::map(add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened there? Well, dat is a matrix, a 2D array in R. It has 360 rows and 180 columns (but yes, we are treating the world map as if it had 360 columns, 180 rows - but that is not this blogpost). Just don’t question it right now, but be assured we are treating the world as having 360 unique whole number longitudes, and 180 unique whole number latitudes.\nWe can image() that, by which I mean draw a pixel map on the screen of all the values in the matrix as if they were a field of little rectangles.\n\nimage(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, that’s very boring because we don’t have any idea where anything is in 0,1 0,1 space.\nWhat if we use xlim and ylim, these are plot() arguments in R (and exist in image() too).\n\nimage(dat, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk that was a trick, our matrix is drawn as a tiny dot right at 0,0, because xlim/ylim is about the plot not the data.\nNo more tricks, image() has 3 arguments x,y,z for normal usage.\n\nimage(x = xs, y = ys, z = dat, asp = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does that work? We essentially have an x coordinate and a y coordinate for every pixel edge. We have one for the left side of the leftmost pixel column, and the second one is the right side of the left most pixel, and so on. We used dm[1] + 1 and dm[2] + 1 up there exactly because we wanted xlim and ylim to be the very extremes of the data.\nCool, explained - a matrix has a coordinate array for each side, we plot it like a map with those. Done."

POINT is a vector, MULTIPOINT is a matrix, POLYGON is a list of matrices (one island, zero or more holes), LINESTRING is a matrix (same as m-point), MULTIPOLYGON is a list of lists of matrices (a list of POLYGONs, effectively), and MULTILINESTRING is a list of matrices (a list of LINESTRINGs, effectively and structurally the same as a POLYGON).\nIf you want to see how to convert between sf forms and extract the raw coordinates I would look at st_cast in, and the leaflet approach here:\nhttps://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/master/R/normalize-sf.R"

R can do all of these things, in many different ways and converting from and to sf is not too difficult.\nPlease don’t get the wrong idea though, sf is invaluable for developing more general tools that can work with these structures. Using the types in sf is very refreshing if you’ve been frustrated trying to pick apart a Spatial object in the past.\nIn terms of going beyong simple features itself, GDAL is also going in this direction: http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2016-December/045675.html\nWe already have most of this capability in R, it’s just scattered all over the place.

I think we can build spatial structures that can store all of these things, so we could throw sf at ggplot2, and use the output as a kind of super-form that knows how to wrap it up into an interactive 4D plot, how to display its primitives etc. etc.\nGIS itself needs what we can already do in R, it’s not a target we are aspring to it’s the other way around."

can tell that every lon,lat pair is stored explicitly. This fits a convention in NetCDF where time is “unlimited” and we’re only looking at a subset of an overall time series, that could well be continually generated day to day still now.\nLet’s investigate the coordinates. We’ll use GDAL via a commonly used wrapper in R, its ‘vsicurl’ protocol to stream from the internet, and declare the driver explicitly (lest we get the less sophisticated HDF5 interpretation).\n\n#dsn &lt;- \"NETCDF:/vsicurl/https://zenodo.org/records/7327711/files/CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc?download=1\"\ndsn &lt;- \"NETCDF:../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\"\nlibrary(terra)\n\nterra 1.8.62\n\nlon &lt;- rast(dsn, \"lon\")\n\nError in R_nc4_open: No such file or directory\n\n\nWarning: [rast] GDAL did not find an extent.

(There’s another message about ncdf4, but ignore that too it’s terra try(ing) stuff. )\nWe won’t pay attention to “time”, because our file only has one time step. We’re interested in these lon,lat coordinates. What does the data itself look like? Again we choose one of the 3D variables (with degenerate 3rd dimension ‘time’) by name.\n\nice &lt;- rast(dsn, \"sea_ice_concentration\")\n\nError in R_nc4_open: No such file or directory\n\n\nWarning: [rast] GDAL did not find an extent.

Now we can see our data in a much more spatial-ish context.\n\nxyz &lt;- values(c(lon, lat, ice))\nplot(xyz[,1:2], pch = \".\", col = palr::d_pal(xyz[,3]), asp = 2)\nmaps::map(\"world2\", add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now don’t have a nice gridded dataset, it’s points in longitude latitude. What can we do to plot it in that nice polar aspect with proper spatial referencing?\nLet’s have a look at this dataset from a GDAL perspective. Now we use the API package gdalraster which gives a lot more control over GDAL itself. I’m going to skip over interrogating the syntax for a particular array, like we did with terra and ‘sea_ice_concentration’ above, I construct the subdataset syntax to open.\n\n\"NETCDF:/vsicurl/https://zenodo.org/records/7327711/files/CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc?download=1\"\n\n[1] \"NETCDF:/vsicurl/https://zenodo.org/records/7327711/files/CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc?download=1\"\n\nsds &lt;- sprintf(\"%s:sea_ice_concentration\", dsn)\nlibrary(gdalraster)\n\nGDAL 3.12.0dev-4e2b27da8f (released 2025-08-26), GEOS 3.12.1, PROJ 9.3.1\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gdalraster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:terra':\n\n    rasterize\n\nds &lt;- new(GDALRaster, sds)\nds$info()\n\nDriver: netCDF/Network Common Data Format\nFiles: ../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\nSize is 316, 332\nMetadata:\n  NC_GLOBAL#history=File created on November 15, 2022, 12:09:06\n  NC_GLOBAL#institution=NASA GSFC Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory and University of Maryland-College Park\n  NC_GLOBAL#title=Antarctic sea ice physical properties obtained from CryoSat-2 using the CS2WFA algorithm\n  NETCDF_DIM_EXTRA={time}\n  NETCDF_DIM_time_DEF={1,5}\n  NETCDF_DIM_time_VALUES=126\n  sea_ice_concentration#description=Mean sea ice concentration in grid cell, from Bootstrap V3 concentration algorithm (Comiso, 2017 https://doi.org/10.5067/7Q8HCCWS4I0R)\n  sea_ice_concentration#least_significant_digit=4\n  sea_ice_concentration#standard_name=sea_ice_area_fraction\n  sea_ice_concentration#units=1\n  time#calendar=360_day\n  time#long_name=time\n  time#units=months since 2000-01-01\nGeolocation:\n  SRS=GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AXIS[\"Latitude\",NORTH],AXIS[\"Longitude\",EAST],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]]\n  X_DATASET=NETCDF:\"../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\":lon\n  X_BAND=1\n  Y_DATASET=NETCDF:\"../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\":lat\n  Y_BAND=1\n  PIXEL_OFFSET=0\n  PIXEL_STEP=1\n  LINE_OFFSET=0\n  LINE_STEP=1\n  GEOREFERENCING_CONVENTION=PIXEL_CENTER\nCorner Coordinates:\nUpper Left  (    0.0,    0.0)\nLower Left  (    0.0,  332.0)\nUpper Right (  316.0,    0.0)\nLower Right (  316.0,  332.0)\nCenter      (  158.0,  166.0)\nBand 1 Block=316x332 Type=Float64, ColorInterp=Undefined\n  NoData Value=9.969209968386869e+36\n  Unit Type: 1\n  Metadata:\n    NETCDF_VARNAME=sea_ice_concentration\n    least_significant_digit=4\n    units=1\n    standard_name=sea_ice_area_fraction\n    description=Mean sea ice concentration in grid cell, from Bootstrap V3 concentration algorithm (Comiso, 2017 https://doi.org/10.5067/7Q8HCCWS4I0R)\n    NETCDF_DIM_time=126\n\n\nThe interesting part of that output is under “Geolocation:”. We can see that while GDAL doesn’t have spatial referencing for this array, it does seem to know that’s it’s possible because of the X_DATASET and Y_DATASET. These can be used by the GDAL warper API (warp means “reprojection” or “reshaping” for an image) in order to resolve to a spatial dataset. So let’s warp.\nWe don’t have to specifying the geolocation arrays, we saw that GDAL already knows this. We’ll write conveniently to a temporary virtual “file” so we can avoid more cleanup.\n\ngdalraster::warp(sds,  tf &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".tif\", tmpdir = \"/vsimem\"), t_srs = \"EPSG:4326\")\n\n0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.\n\nplot(icegrid &lt;- rast(tf))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicegrid\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 127, 902, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.398722, 0.3987662  (x, y)\nextent      : 0.164645, 359.8119, -89.80441, -39.1611  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) \nsource      : fileb833358a66fe0.tif \nname        : fileb833358a66fe0 \n\n\nWe indeed now have a spatial grid, a raster.

So we change CRS. ‘EPSG:3412’ is a Polar Stereographic map projection on the south pole, commonly used for standard sea ice products. As a grid this has nice properties, that don’t require edge-wrap for a matrix model, it’s true scale at approximately where the coastline of Antarctica is, and it preserves shape (this means not all cells are exactly the same size, but they’re close enough for where the sea ice is).\n\ngdalraster::warp(sds,  tf &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".tif\", tmpdir = \"/vsimem\"), t_srs = \"EPSG:3412\", \n                cl_arg = c(\"-to\", \"GEOLOC_NORMALIZE_LONGITUDE_MINUS_180_PLUS_180=YES\"))\n\n0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.\n\nplot(polargrid &lt;- rast(tf))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npolargrid\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 348, 332, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 24999.84, 24999.84  (x, y)\nextent      : -3950080, 4349868, -4337584, 4362361  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic South (EPSG:3412) \nsource      : fileb83334e8575d1.tif \nname        : fileb83334e8575d1 \n\n\nTo make sure let’s get some spatial data to plot with this.\n\nv &lt;- vect(\"/vsizip//vsicurl/https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/raw/main/releaseData/CGAZ/geoBoundariesCGAZ_ADM0.zip\", \n     query = \"SELECT shapeGroup FROM geoBoundariesCGAZ_ADM0 WHERE shapeGroup IN ('ATA')\")\nv &lt;- crop(v, ext(-180, 180, -84, 0)) ## small hack to remove the pole seam\nv &lt;- project(v, \"EPSG:3412\")\nplot(polargrid)\nplot(v, add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks good!

can tell that every lon,lat pair is stored explicitly. This fits a convention in NetCDF where time is “unlimited” and we’re only looking at a subset of an overall time series, that could well be continually generated day to day still now.\nLet’s investigate the coordinates. We’ll use GDAL via a commonly used wrapper in R, its ‘vsicurl’ protocol to stream from the internet, and declare the driver explicitly (lest we get the less sophisticated HDF5 interpretation).\n\n#dsn &lt;- \"NETCDF:/vsicurl/https://zenodo.org/records/7327711/files/CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc?download=1\"\ndsn &lt;- \"NETCDF:../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\"\nlibrary(terra)\n\nterra 1.8.62\n\nlon &lt;- rast(dsn, \"lon\")\n\nError in R_nc4_open: No such file or directory\n\n\nWarning: [rast] GDAL did not find an extent.

(There’s another message about ncdf4, but ignore that too it’s terra try(ing) stuff. )\nWe won’t pay attention to “time”, because our file only has one time step. We’re interested in these lon,lat coordinates. What does the data itself look like? Again we choose one of the 3D variables (with degenerate 3rd dimension ‘time’) by name.\n\nice &lt;- rast(dsn, \"sea_ice_concentration\")\n\nError in R_nc4_open: No such file or directory\n\n\nWarning: [rast] GDAL did not find an extent.

What can we do to plot it in that nice polar aspect with proper spatial referencing?\nLet’s have a look at this dataset from a GDAL perspective. Now we use the API package gdalraster which gives a lot more control over GDAL itself. I’m going to skip over interrogating the syntax for a particular array, like we did with terra and ‘sea_ice_concentration’ above, I construct the subdataset syntax to open.\n\n\"NETCDF:/vsicurl/https://zenodo.org/records/7327711/files/CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc?download=1\"\n\n[1] \"NETCDF:/vsicurl/https://zenodo.org/records/7327711/files/CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc?download=1\"\n\nsds &lt;- sprintf(\"%s:sea_ice_concentration\", dsn)\nlibrary(gdalraster)\n\nGDAL 3.12.0dev-4e2b27da8f (released 2025-08-26), GEOS 3.12.1, PROJ 9.3.1\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gdalraster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:terra':\n\n    rasterize\n\nds &lt;- new(GDALRaster, sds)\nds$info()\n\nDriver: netCDF/Network Common Data Format\nFiles: ../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\nSize is 316, 332\nMetadata:\n  NC_GLOBAL#history=File created on November 15, 2022, 12:09:06\n  NC_GLOBAL#institution=NASA GSFC Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory and University of Maryland-College Park\n  NC_GLOBAL#title=Antarctic sea ice physical properties obtained from CryoSat-2 using the CS2WFA algorithm\n  NETCDF_DIM_EXTRA={time}\n  NETCDF_DIM_time_DEF={1,5}\n  NETCDF_DIM_time_VALUES=126\n  sea_ice_concentration#description=Mean sea ice concentration in grid cell, from Bootstrap V3 concentration algorithm (Comiso, 2017 https://doi.org/10.5067/7Q8HCCWS4I0R)\n  sea_ice_concentration#least_significant_digit=4\n  sea_ice_concentration#standard_name=sea_ice_area_fraction\n  sea_ice_concentration#units=1\n  time#calendar=360_day\n  time#long_name=time\n  time#units=months since 2000-01-01\nGeolocation:\n  SRS=GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AXIS[\"Latitude\",NORTH],AXIS[\"Longitude\",EAST],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]]\n  X_DATASET=NETCDF:\"../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\":lon\n  X_BAND=1\n  Y_DATASET=NETCDF:\"../CS2WFA_25km_201007.nc\":lat\n  Y_BAND=1\n  PIXEL_OFFSET=0\n  PIXEL_STEP=1\n  LINE_OFFSET=0\n  LINE_STEP=1\n  GEOREFERENCING_CONVENTION=PIXEL_CENTER\nCorner Coordinates:\nUpper Left  (    0.0,    0.0)\nLower Left  (    0.0,  332.0)\nUpper Right (  316.0,    0.0)\nLower Right (  316.0,  332.0)\nCenter      (  158.0,  166.0)\nBand 1 Block=316x332 Type=Float64, ColorInterp=Undefined\n  NoData Value=9.969209968386869e+36\n  Unit Type: 1\n  Metadata:\n    NETCDF_VARNAME=sea_ice_concentration\n    least_significant_digit=4\n    units=1\n    standard_name=sea_ice_area_fraction\n    description=Mean sea ice concentration in grid cell, from Bootstrap V3 concentration algorithm (Comiso, 2017 https://doi.org/10.5067/7Q8HCCWS4I0R)\n    NETCDF_DIM_time=126\n\n\nThe interesting part of that output is under “Geolocation:”. We can see that while GDAL doesn’t have spatial referencing for this array, it does seem to know that’s it’s possible because of the X_DATASET and Y_DATASET. These can be used by the GDAL warper API (warp means “reprojection” or “reshaping” for an image) in order to resolve to a spatial dataset. So let’s warp.\nWe don’t have to specifying the geolocation arrays, we saw that GDAL already knows this. We’ll write conveniently to a temporary virtual “file” so we can avoid more cleanup.\n\ngdalraster::warp(sds,  tf &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".tif\", tmpdir = \"/vsimem\"), t_srs = \"EPSG:4326\")\n\n0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.\n\nplot(icegrid &lt;- rast(tf))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nicegrid\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 127, 902, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.398722, 0.3987662  (x, y)\nextent      : 0.164645, 359.8119, -89.80441, -39.1611  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) \nsource      : fileb833358a66fe0.tif \nname        : fileb833358a66fe0 \n\n\nWe indeed now have a spatial grid, a raster.

Here’s the answer:\n\nex &lt;- c(xmin = -3950000,  xmax = 3950000, ymin  = -3950000, ymax = 4350000)\ndiff(ex)[c(1, 3)] / c(316, 332)  ## look familiar?\n\n xmax  ymax \n25000 25000 \n\n\n\nset_ext &lt;- function(x, ex) {terra::ext(x) &lt;- ex; x}\n\nplot(set_ext(ice, ext(ex)))\nplot(v, add = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(polargrid); plot(v, add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow finally, we get exactly the same answer.\n\ngdalraster::warp(sds,  tf &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".tif\", tmpdir = \"/vsimem\"), t_srs = \"EPSG:3412\", \n                cl_arg = c(\"-ts\", 316, 332, \"-te\", ex[1], ex[3], ex[2], ex[4],\n                           \n                  \"-to\", \"GEOLOC_NORMALIZE_LONGITUDE_MINUS_180_PLUS_180=YES\"))\n\n0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.\n\npolargrid &lt;- rast(tf)\n\npolargrid\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 332, 316, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 25000, 25000  (x, y)\nextent      : -3950000, 3950000, -3950000, 4350000  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic South (EPSG:3412) \nsource      : fileb833318ec58b9.tif \nname        : fileb833318ec58b9 \n\npolargrid - set_ext(ice, ext(ex))\n\nWarning: [-] CRS do not match\n\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \nsize        : 332, 316, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 25000, 25000  (x, y)\nextent      : -3950000, 3950000, -3950000, 4350000  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic South (EPSG:3412) \nsource(s)   : memory\nvarname     : fileb833318ec58b9 \nname        : fileb833318ec58b9 \nmin value   :                 0 \nmax value   :                 0 \n\n# class       : SpatRaster \n# size        : 332, 316, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\n# resolution  : 25000, 25000  (x, y)\n# extent      : -3950000, 3950000, -3950000, 4350000  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\n# coord. ref. : NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic South (EPSG:3412) \n# source(s)   : memory\n# varname     : fileb328ade0cec2 \n# name        : fileb328ade0cec2 \n# min value   :                0 \n# max value   :                0 \n\nBut how did we do that? We plucked some magic numbers out of the air. We can’t obtain those four numbers from the lon lat arrays, we can’t find them in the file, they aren’t in the metadata or the website. We just know, because NSIDC sea ice products are standard on a 3412 grid at 25km resolution.\nThis is an entropy problem."
