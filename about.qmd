I'm a researcher at the [Australian Antarctic Division](https://www.aad.gov.au/) in Hobart, working on geospatial data systems for Southern Ocean and Antarctic science. My day job involves satellite imagery, ocean model outputs, and tracking data — which means a lot of rasters, meshes, and coordinate transformations.

I maintain the [hypertidy](https://github.com/hypertidy) family of R packages (see the [packages listing](/packages.html)) and contribute to the broader R geospatial ecosystem. Most of what I build is motivated by problems that come up in research: needing direct access to GDAL without heavy abstractions, working with grids that don't fit the GIS raster mould, and connecting raster and vector through mesh-based data structures.

I originally created [vapour](https://github.com/hypertidy/vapour) to give R direct, dependency-light access to the GDAL C API — read raster and vector data without importing the whole spatial stack. Chris Toney's [gdalraster](https://github.com/firelab/gdalraster) now easily supersedes vapour, with comprehensive bindings and an active community. It's where I'd point anyone who wants to work close to GDAL in R today.

Hypertidy is a collaborative effort. [Mark Padgham](https://github.com/mpadge) wrote [geodist](https://github.com/hypertidy/geodist) and contributed core C++ to [laridae](https://github.com/hypertidy/laridae), and was central to the topology discussions that shaped [silicate](https://github.com/hypertidy/silicate). [Noam Ross](https://github.com/noamross) at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) originally created [fasterize](https://github.com/hypertidy/fasterize). [tidync](https://github.com/ropensci/tidync) went through rOpenSci review. Every day I rely on a collaborative data collection built with [bowerbird](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/bowerbird) by [Ben Raymond](https://github.com/raymondben) at the AAD.

This blog is where I write about GDAL, raster logic, NetCDF, coordinate systems, and the R packages that tie them together.

## The hypertidy philosophy

Hypertidy is built on a few core ideas:

**Spatial is not special.** User interfaces, graphics, and time-series all involve "space". Date-time is a projection. Longitude-latitude is a projection. They're all mappings to a coordinate axis.

**Raster and vector are not naturally distinct.** High-dimensional, curvilinear, cell-based rasters, polygon grids, and ragged arrays all cross the traditional raster/vector boundary. Both are special cases of mesh structures — GIS just optimized for the extremes.

**Topology matters.** Simple features left topology behind, resulting in fragmented and inefficient workarounds. Polygons are topologically identical to closed lines. Points, lines, and surfaces are 0-, 1-, and 2-dimensional primitives whose topology is independent of their geometry.

**Data sources are databases.** Manage what you have, use clever indexing, don't materialize what you don't need. This is what GDAL does well, and it's what [vapour](https://github.com/hypertidy/vapour) exposes directly.

**Small, composable tools.** R spatial needs better APIs — a rich ecosystem of focused packages rather than monolithic frameworks. Thin wrappers over GDAL and PROJ, not heavy abstractions on top of them.

**Structured and unstructured grids are a continuum.** Array-based data have a regular indexing relationship between dimensions. Unstructured grids — triangulations, tetrahedral meshes, ragged arrays — can represent anything. GIS vectors are a special-case optimization of the unstructured case. The general solution is the mesh.
