R packages and tools for geospatial data, mostly under the [hypertidy](https://github.com/hypertidy) organisation. Install
development versions from [r-universe](https://hypertidy.r-universe.dev):

```r
options(repos = c(
  hypertidy = "https://hypertidy.r-universe.dev",
  mdsumner  = "https://mdsumner.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN      = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```
